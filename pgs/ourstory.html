				<h3>The Beginnings</h3>
				<p>Both Jacob and I have felt for a few years now that God has very clearly called us to overseas mission work. We have seen God work in amazing ways to reaffirm this call on our lives, and after much research on what type of mission work we would pursue, we settled on an organization called New Tribes Mission. New Tribes works to plant churches in tribal communities. There are currently 6,500 people groups around the world, 2,500 of which are still unreached with the word of God. We are so excited to be joining a mission that works in this capacity, and we know that God has done amazing things through New Tribes.</p>
				<h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
				<p>In 2014-15, we completed a year of Bible School training in Jackson, Michigan through the New Tribes Bible Institute. Jacob also completed his masters in Global Studies through Liberty University by December of 2015. From July to October of 2015, we were in Papua New Guinea participating in an internship with New Tribes Mission. When we got back in October, we began work as interim youth ministers at our home church, Trinity Covenant Church in Connecticut, where we are currently living. We have been officially accepted to the next phase of training with New Tribes which is at the Missionary Training Center in Missouri. This training begins this August, 2016.</p>
