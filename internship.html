			<h3>The Internship</h3>
			<p>There are many things we will be doing on our internship but we just wanted to share a few highlights with you. First, we will go through an orientation and language learning process where we will learn some Melanesian Pidgin (the national language of Papua New Guinea). We will learn how to gather culture information and how to analyze it. We will be learning how to teach illiterate people how to read and write in their own language, as well as some of the basic principles of Bible translation- specifically how to translate the Bible in a way tribal people can understand in their cultural context. One of the parts of the trip we are MOST excited for will be spending time in an early church development- basically visiting a tribe where church planters are still in the process of learning language and culture in order to share the word of God. We will also visit a mature, indigenous tribal church where we will get to see firsthand the results of church planting and worship with our tribal brothers and sisters in Christ!<br>We are hoping to go to Papua New Guinea at the end of JULY!! This internship opportunity is ideal for us as this is the type of work we hope to commit our future to.</p>
			<h3>Our Future</h3>
			<p>The next step for us after we return from the internship in October is to begin full time missionary training at the New Tribes Missionary Training Center in Missouri. The program is two years in length where we are intensively trained in a range of skills including linguistics, cultural studies, and some medical skills. We are hoping to head to the Training Center Fall of 2016.</p>
