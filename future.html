			<h3>Where We Are Headed</h3>
			<p>We are so excited about where we feel God is leading us in our next steps! Jacob needs to complete an internship in a different cultural context to finish off his masterâ€™s degree. As we did some praying and searching, we discovered New Tribes has a church planting internship in Papua New Guinea.  This was a huge opportunity for us as this is exactly what we hope to commit our future to! We have been told by many missionaries that if we have the opportunity to visit a country where church planting is happening, to take it!  We see this trip as an essential step in our training towards full time missions.<br>The Papua New Guinea and Indonesia areas are a huge focus for New Tribes. There are still many thousands of languages to be learned. New Tribes has received notice of tribes begging for missionaries because they see the difference in neighboring tribal communities where the gospel has been presented. Instead of living in constant fear, their neighbors have a new hope.<br></p>
