				<h2>Who We Are</h2>
				<p>Welcome to our site! We are from Connecticut, born and raised.  We know God desires to redeem his fallen creation, and that includes every tribe and nation of the world.  We want to be a part of bringing the saving words of God to the most remote people of the world who have no chance of hearing the gospel.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statement">
				<h2>Our Hope</h2>
				<p>Our hope in creating this page is that you would begin to pray for us. We have become keenly aware of our need for prayer support as we begin to make some large life decisions. We know that God has called us to this, and now we need a team of prayerful supporters to help us reach the world.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="statement">
				<h2>Support</h2>
				<p>We would also like you to begin praying about financially supporting us. The cost to do the Papua New Guinea internship is about $20,000. Two is better than one, according to God’s word, so we hope and pray you would consider joining us in this journey, both now as we pursue this internship, and long term as we become full time missionaries. If you would like to support us you can find out how to do so <a href="donate.html"><strong>here</strong></a></p>

				<h2>About New Tribes</h2>
				<p><img id="ntlogo" src="newtribes.jpg"><br>In 2,500 of the world’s 6,500 people groups, there is no church, nor is there any work being done to establish a church. These are the people among whom NTM works.<br>These tribes’ cultures and languages have isolated them from the Gospel. Missionaries must learn their language and understand their culture in order to clearly present the Gospel and effectively plant a church.<br>Unreached people groups have no concept of the God of the Bible. So Bible teaching begins at the same place God began with His chosen people: at the beginning. Chronological Bible teaching presents a foundation for understanding Jesus’ death and resurrection.<br>Following the pattern seen in Acts as God’s people carried out the Great Commission, missionaries seek to establish mature churches that can take their rightful place as agents of change in their own communities and partners in the Great Commission.
